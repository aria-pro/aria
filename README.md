We want to build a matrix system. The matrix system has 1,000 machines. Each machine is a cellular automaton system. The cellular automaton system has another 1,000 * 1,000 * 1,000 neuron cells. These neuron cells are represented by squares. They will update the internal state according to corresponding rules, similar to the human brain, so as to build a truly intelligent artificial intelligence.
